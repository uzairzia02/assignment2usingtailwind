          With over 4 years of hands-on experience in Human Resources, I have progressively developed expertise in talent acquisition, employee lifecycle management, and HR operations. Currently serving as an HR Executive at Chase Value, I manage recruitment, onboarding, payroll, and employee relations. My previous role as Assistant Manager HR at Ronin allowed me to lead the full recruitment process, create HR policies, and manage employee engagement activities. Additionally, I have experience in administrative tasks, HRMS management, and ensuring a positive work environment. My career began at Forrun (Pvt) Ltd, followed by a technical recruitment internship at Tafsol Technologies. This diverse background equips me with the skills to handle the complete spectrum of HR functions efficiently.
